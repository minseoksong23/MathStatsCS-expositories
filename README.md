This repository is mainly an effort to deepen my intuitive grasp of fundamental mathematical concepts that I believe could benefit from further examination. It also serves as a space for me to reorganize existing knowledge and draw connections between various ideas. Most of the proofs provided here will be succinct and are intended solely for my personal use at this time.
